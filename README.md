# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays
We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a linear sorting algorithm that sorts elements by processing them digit
by digit. It is an efficient sorting algorithm for integers or strings with fixed-size keys. 

The algorithm is implemented in C.
